FINANCIAL CRIMES ENFORCEMENT & ADVERSE ACTION COMPLIANCE REPORT
INCIDENT REFERENCE: SAR-SG-{cluster_id:04d} | TIMESTAMP: {timestamp}
REGULATORY GOVERNANCE: ECOA REGULATION B (12 CFR § 1002.9) / CFPB CIRCULAR 2023-03 / EU AI ACT (REG. 2024/1689 ART 13/14) / RBI DIRECTIONS
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
On {timestamp}, the ShadowGram Behavioral Forensics Engine isolated a coordinated
adversarial multi-account syndicate (Cluster #{cluster_id}) consisting of {size} ostensibly
independent loan applicants. Topological {algorithm} community detection confirmed a modularity
coefficient of Q = {modularity_q:.4f}. Empirical null model permutation testing against 1,000 degree-preserving
random graphs established a significance of p = {p_value:.4f} (p < 0.001), rejecting the null hypothesis
of organic coincidence. Interception occurred at Form Step 2, preventing ₹{dow_savings:.2f} in
Denial-of-Wallet (DoW) verification drain (UIDAI ₹3.00, PAN ₹2.00, Liveness ₹6.00, Bureau ₹50.00 per account).

FACTUAL ADVERSE ACTION REASON CODES (STATUTORY REGULATION B AUDIT TRAIL):

1. REASON CODE CR-01: HIGH-DENSITY FINITE STATE MACHINE (FSM) ROUTE LOCKSTEP
   The {size} flagged sessions exhibited an identical 4-step Single Page Application (SPA)
   navigation trajectory (/auth -> /kyc -> /loan_details -> /submit) with an invariant
   transition sequence (LCS similarity >= 0.85), indicating deterministic script automation.

2. REASON CODE CR-02: SUB-SECOND MICRO-TEMPORAL INGRESS PHASE-LOCKING
   Ingress network arrival timestamps across all {size} endpoints converged within a
   tight window of delta_t < 38 milliseconds, evaluated via exponential decay kernel
   (Iannucci et al., 2026), incompatible with uncoordinated human motor capability (p < 0.00001).

3. REASON CODE CR-03: EVENT-STREAM DISTRIBUTION INVARIANCE & ZERO-JERK MOTOR SIGNATURE
   Browser click-dwell durations demonstrated near-zero variance (sigma < 15ms) across form interactions,
   and cursor trajectory jerk was mathematically constant (derivative d^3x/dt^3 = 0), lacking the physiological
   8-12 Hz neuromuscular tremor observed in organic human motor control.

4. REASON CODE CR-04: CROSS-APPLICATION SEMANTIC PROMPT HOMOGENEITY
   Dense semantic text embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384 dimensions) revealed a pairwise cosine
   similarity >= 0.88 across stated loan justifications, establishing LLM prompt-template automation.

COMPLIANCE OFFICER DIRECTIVE:
Reversible quarantine step-up challenge enforced pursuant to FinCEN AML and Anti-Fraud
mandates. Downstream third-party KYC and credit disbursement API calls aborted.
Real human applicants may clear quarantine via 1-rupee UPI penny-drop verification within 10 seconds.
